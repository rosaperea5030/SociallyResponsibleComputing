For academic environments
# Academic Roster Management Program

This program aims for reusable code for parsing student information in academic environments.  
The use of soft delete is implemented, giving future use of this program an extra firewall against potential mistakes during the data entry process.

Within our program, we flagged mistakes, preventing student information from being lost forever and making it possible for those mistakes to be easily fixed by the next programmer.
