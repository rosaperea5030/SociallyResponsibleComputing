# Socially Responsible Computing - Academic Roster Project

This program demonstrates reusable code for parsing student information in academic environments.

### Key Features:
- Soft delete to flag invalid records instead of erasing them
- Validation of email formats
- Calculation of average days per course
- Filtering by degree program(Security, Networking, Software)

This solution helps preserve data integrity and makes it easier for future developers to review or fix issues.
